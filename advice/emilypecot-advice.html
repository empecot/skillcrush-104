			<h4>Deep breaths--You WILL find a solution!</h4>
			<p>One thing I keep encountering in my journey as a beginning developer is the feeling of panic. Panic as in, "Holy crap, I can't figure out this problem, I don't know what to do, I'm never going to be a real developer."</p>
			<p>If you too encounter this situation, my advice is to take some DEEP BREATHS, walk away from the project for a bit, and if you're really stuck, ask a developer friend for help. Sometimes you just need another set of eyes on your code.</p>
			<p>Also, just remember, every developer has been in the same situation. We all have bugs we can't figure out. And sometimes they're so simple and stupid that you want to stab yourself in the eye!</p>
